        <p>At hope Donors, we strongly believe that animals 
            deserve to live their life free of pain and full of hope and love.<br>
             Therefore, we try to give them the life we believe they deserve on a daily basis. 
             However, we need your help to reach out and help more of them.<br>

            Unfortunately, in many parts of the world animals are stray with no one to take care
             of them or are being abandoned by their owners.<br> <mark>Animal abandonment</mark> is a widespread issue,
              with only 11% of abandoned entering shelters as strays are returned or taken back by their owners.<br>
               Many of them become ill, injure or suffer abuses on the streets and require doctors, medicine,
                surgeries, 
               and shelter to survive.<Br> Depending on the nature of illness or injury, veterinary costs including 
               surgery 
               can exceed $8,000.<br>

                At Hope Donors, we are saving the animals. <br>We find, provide medical 
                care and shelter to give them the life they deserve.<br> We kindly ask you to donate hope
                 and love to these animals and help us to keep our promises to them.</p>

                 <h4>What Is the Difference Between an Animal Rescue and an Animal Shelter?</h4>#

                 <p>The differences between <b>animal shelters</b> and <b>animal rescues</b>> can be difficult to nail down.
                     This is because there is a great level of ambiguity and flexibility surrounding the two terms. <br>
                     Some places that interpret the term <strong>“animal rescue”</strong> broadly might even house animal shelters as a subset 
                     of animal rescues.<br> If there were to be a key difference it would be that generally speaking, animal shelters
                      tend to have facilities that house animals whereas animal rescues are typically foster-based organizations. <br>
                      This does not mean, however, that <u>animal shelters</u> do not have fosters, as many do.<br> Many animal rescues also 
                      partner with boarding facilities to house their animals adding to the ambiguity between the two.<br> Regardless of what they call themselves, 
                    both types of organizations have a common goal: <br> they exist to help animals. </p>

                    <q>“anyone who has no feelings for animals has a dead heart.”
                        ― Raegan Butcher, Rusty String Quartet</q>
                    <blockquote>“I think he just loved being with the bears because they didn't make him feel bad.<br> I get it too. When he was with the bears, they didn't care that he was kind of weird, 
                        <br> or that he'd gotten into trouble for drinking too much and using drugs(which apparently he did a lot of). <br> They didn't ask him a bunch of stupid questions about how he felt, or why he did what he did.
                        <br> They just let him be who he was.”
                        ― Michael Thomas Ford, Suicide Notes</blockquote>
